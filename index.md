Privacy Policy for Financial Co-Pilot
Last Updated: June 29, 2025

Disclaimer: This is a template and not legal advice. You should consult with a legal professional to ensure your privacy policy is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA.

1. Introduction

Welcome to Financial Co-Pilot ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and process your information when you use our mobile application.

2. Information We Collect and How We Use It

Our core philosophy is to collect as little information as possible. The app is designed to perform all its primary calculations directly on your device.

Information You Provide: When you use the calculators within the App (e.g., Salary, Budget, Mortgage), you enter financial data such as your salary, expenses, and debt amounts. This information is processed only on your device to perform the calculations you request. It is not stored, saved, or transmitted to us. Once you close the app, this information is gone unless you re-enter it.

Information for AI Features: The App includes features that use Google's Gemini API to provide you with insights (e.g., "AI Salary Benchmark," "Payslip Analyzer," "Investment Education Hub"). When you use these specific features, the data you've entered into that feature's input fields (such as your salary, job title, or a financial question) is sent to Google's servers to generate a response.

We do not store your prompts or the AI's responses.

Your use of these AI features is subject to Google's own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them.

3. Third-Party Services

Google's Gemini API: As mentioned above, some features rely on the Google Gemini API. The information sent to this service is used solely for the purpose of generating the AI response you have requested within the app.

4. Data Security

Since we do not store your personal or financial data on our servers, the primary security of your data rests on the security of your own device. We recommend you use all available security features on your phone, such as passcodes and biometric locks.

5. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
